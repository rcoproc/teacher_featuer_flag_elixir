This was a POC for using feature flags in elixir.

In this small project I used these two libs:

https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags

https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags_ui

To view the feature-flags dashboard run:

    https://localhost:4000/feature-flags



To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
